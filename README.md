# Requirements

## Using Git LFS

This project uses Git LFS (Large File Storage) to handle large files. Before cloning or working with the repository, make sure you have Git LFS installed on your machine.

### Installing Git LFS

You can download Git LFS from [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/), or by executing the following command in a terminal:

```
git lfs install
```

After installing Git LFS, the large files in this repository will be automatically handled. No additional configuration is needed.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to practice common game development processes for curiosity. For this, Godot 4.2.1 is being used. Random topics are chosen based on personal interests. Everything shall be considered an endless work in progress with no coherence or expectations. References to the used tutorials / guides / documentations will be ommitted for now; the point is to make this a quick and enjoyable exploration with backups behind.

Got busy all month editing and publishing my newest book: "Alcarodian Tales, Evergreen", Spanish edition. The Kindle and English editions will come out soon too, free for 5 days every 3 months in Amazon, might get busy again. Could only work on a few things meanwhile, like tweaking Lucas' pathfinding, but it needs more work, he flickers badly when touching the edge of his navigation area. There are plenty of fixes, but I am deciding which one could be best, the most "realistic" one. Same for the project's structure, I know it'd be exageratted for a 2D game like this, but I want to learn what it would be like to manage such a project, those that aim to simulate real life as close as possible.

For the menu, I plan to learn how to animate it either in the engine or outside, whatever is best, and try to adapt it with a fictional company intro and this song I liked: https://uppbeat.io/track/all-good-folks/quantum-fire see how it goes.

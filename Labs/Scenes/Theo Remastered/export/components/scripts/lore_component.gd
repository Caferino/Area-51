class_name LoreComponent extends Node
## The entity's [color=ivory]lore.

## This can probably hold the dialogues and descriptions
## Probably does not need to extend anything, who knows
## This could probably be a JSON, TXT or something else

## ! I do not think this can be shared, so it must be a template and have its
## ! own unique script for each entity. Wish I could color de node yellow gold
## Could also be the only white node with children, lore or stories the character
## has done. This script could be a controller/interface/manager for them

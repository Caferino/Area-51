class_name SmallTree extends WoodenTree
## A [color=green]big tree.

const MAX_HEALTH : float = 20.0  ## The tree's max health points.

## TODO - Maybe I should define the loot_radius and more here, to be able
## to create more unique trees easily. Might need to refactor WoodenTree and
## probably create a more general class Tree, we will see. FOCUS ON AI FOR NOW

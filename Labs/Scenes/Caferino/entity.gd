class_name Entity extends CharacterBody2D

## This is where the general stats of every entity/mob can go:
## e.x.: Level... (What if not every entity has stamina, speed, intelligence, dexterity, etc.?)
## What do all entities share in common other than a Level? HP?
## Keep those things on their respective entity files or create the default values here?

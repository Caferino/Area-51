class_name WindComponent extends Node2D
## Manages wind areas.

## Every wind component will manage wind areas. If this component exists in the scene, it means
## there has to be at least one wind area present, this is why it comes with one already; however,
## more can be added, with different sizes and timings.

## WARN - Remember. Wizards and such bend reality, they don't necessarily create

## WARN NOTE - MIGHT DEPRECATE THIS, WINDAREA CAN GO IN LEVELSPACECOMPONENT
## BECAUSE I MIGHT HAVE DESIGNED THEM THE SAME AS RAIN

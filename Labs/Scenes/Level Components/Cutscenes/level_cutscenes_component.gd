class_name CutscenesComponent extends Node2D
## The level's [color=pink]cutscenes manager.

## There are so many ways to make cutscenes.
## One of the most recommended are those you can trigger mid-action,
## without teleporting or changing the state of the player, whatever it was doing.
## For example, God of War, Uncharted, The Last of Us... They are seamless.
## In 2D, maybe think Pokemon, I think. But I can go deeper than that.

## Can use animationplayers or just code, or both. Black bars, pathfinders with
## smooth curves and slowing the camera on certain spots to make it smoother or
## highlight parts of the level.

## I can even film them like I'd film youtube videos, and play them here,
## although that would kind of suck maybe, unless it's a cinematic in the beginning
## or end or something like that

## WARN - This game might not need that many cutscenes, or any at all. So,
## I should focus on the game itself now. The need for cutscenes might come later.
## I don't really have a solid plot or story to tell yet.
